# PCB-design-of-Arduino-UNO-using-EAGLE
PCB (Printed Circuit Board) designing is the process of creating the layout and design of a printed circuit board used to connect electronic components. I designed my first PCB using EAGLE Software! I designed an Arduino UNO board with basic features, including a Microcontroller module, Power Module, and input/output pins. EAGLE is electronic design automation (EDA) software that lets printed circuit board (PCB) designers seamlessly connect schematic diagrams, component placement, PCB routing and comprehensive library content.  EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor
